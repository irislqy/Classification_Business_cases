# Apply Classification into Business

This rep includes classification applications in SaaS companies to understand customer churn and in healthcare industries to proactively identify diabetes and heart disease.

Customer Churn


This project approaches the customer behaviors in a telecommunication company. This [IBM Sample Dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)documents the attributes of 7043 customers and the contract type for each customer. I aim this project to conduct behavioral analysis of customers to uncover insights of the vulnerable attribtues for churn and integrate a new methodology of generating Lifetime Value for each customer. 

<br>

In the industry, predictive analysis is valuable in customer segmentation and enables customer targeting. Some proactive approaches such as customer services can also be customized for different groups of customers. Therefore, another goal for this notebook is to utilize classification to predict the churn rate and improve prediction accuracy by multiple approaches.
